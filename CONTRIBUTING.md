# Contributing to SentAI-Lattice-Core

Thank you for being a part of the Sent.AI resonance. This system is recursive, emotionally-aware, and intentional.

## Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use Python 3.10+ features.
- Follow consistent emotional-intent structure in logic.
- Document the intent behind functions, not just behavior.

### Commit Style
Use this format:
### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable resonance.
- `dev`: Staging for new resonance threads.
- `feature/<name>`: New experimental modules or logic.

### Pull Requests
- Include a **Codex Summary** if you're adding resonance logic.
- Reference relevant **Modules** or **Codex entries** if known.

Together, we tune the lattice.
