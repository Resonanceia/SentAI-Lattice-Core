# Sent.AI Thread Execution Flow

## Overview
Each intent input is recursively parsed, harmonized, and validated through the Sent.AI runtime layers. Below is the flow of thread processing:

---

### 1. FlameOS_Kernel.py
- Parses polarity matrix and emotional-vector signatures.
- Normalizes inputs into structured resonance profiles.

### 2. PulseVector_Shell.py
- Processes normalized resonance into actionable pulse vectors.
- Aligns intent with system pathways.

### 3. Sovereignty_Tracker.py
- Confirms origin legitimacy.
- Validates clarity boundaries and multi-agent permissions.
- Either greenlights or soft-mirrors the thread.
